### Python: Getting Started

A barebones Django app, which can easily be deployed to Heroku.

This application supports the [Getting Started with Python on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python) article - check it out.

### Running Locally

Make sure you have Python 3.9 [installed locally](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/installation/). To push to Heroku, you'll need to install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli), as well as [Postgres](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql#local-setup).

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/heroku/python-getting-started.git
$ cd python-getting-started

$ python3 -m venv getting-started
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

$ createdb python_getting_started

$ python manage.py migrate
$ python manage.py collectstatic

$ heroku local
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).

### Deploying to Heroku

```sh
$ heroku create
$ git push heroku main

$ heroku run python manage.py migrate
$ heroku open
```
or

# Segment One
In segment one we'll complete the following tasks:
- Create the foundation for the final project and - importantly - decide on a topic/question that can be answered using data
- Define roles between team members and establish a team communication structure
- Source a dataset, and begin to clean, organize, and perform exploratory data analysis
- Create mockups of a machine learning model, a database, and a firm grasp of how you want these different pieces to interact

### Project Topic: Particulate Matter and COVID-19 Outcomes
Air pollution is a major public health concern due to its negative impact on individual and population health. A major component of air pollution is particulate matter - all the solid and liquid particles suspended in air. Particulate matter (PM) can enter the body through inhalation, and may negatively impact peoples' respiratory, cardiovascular, cardiopulmonary, and reproductive systems. The route of entry - and system affected - depends on the size, shape, and concentration or density of the particulate matter.

We have chosen PM 2.5, specifically, because this size of particulate matter can reach the lower respiratory system. Studies have shown that increased concentrations of fine particulate matter can cause elevated susceptibility to respiratory disease. This, in turn, may exascerbate the symptoms caused by COVID-19, and increase hospitalizations and deaths due to COVID-19.

## Work as a Team
As a virtual team, we share the same goal - but we have different obligations and responsibilities outside of this project. In order to reach our goal, we will communicate through Slack and work concurrently via Github. Group members are expected to meet on Monday and Wednesday nights, communicate regularly, do their best to acheive goals, and reach out if issues arise.

T help our team reach our goal for this segment of the project, we've assigned roles which are outlined below:
- Square: The team member in the square role will be responsible for the repository. (Ibrahim)

- Triangle: The member in the triangle role will create a mockup of a machine learning model. This can even be a diagram that explains how it will work concurrently with the rest of the project steps. (Robert)

- Circle: The member in the circle role will create a mockup of a database with a set of sample data, or even fabricated data. This will ensure the database will work seamlessly with the rest of the project. (Joe)

- X: The member in the X role will decide which technologies will be used for each step of the project. (Edgar)

## Machine Learning Model (see Covid_PM_Model.ipynb for basic script outline)
Present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following:

- Takes in data from the provisional database
- Outputs label for input data

The basic procedure for implementing a supervised learning model is as follows: create a model, train the model, and then create predictions.

Our model will use logistic regression to predict a binary outcome - two possible outcomes. Our logistic regression will be able to decide, based on county level data, whether higher concentrations of PM 2.5 is associated with increased COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths.

 We'll take the following steps to use a logistic regression model:

- Create a model with LogisticRegression().
- Train the model with model.fit().
- Make predictions with model.predict().
- Validate the model with accuracy_score().

## Database Integration
Pulling data from covidactnow.org and US EPA using following api:
- apidocs.covidactnow.org
- United States Evironmental Protection Agency
- - https://www.epa.gov/air-trends/air-quality-cities-and-counties
